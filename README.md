Basic Python Programming Guide
Welcome to a basic introduction to Python programming! This guide will walk you through fundamental aspects of Python, providing you with a strong foundation to build upon. By exploring the examples and trying your own modifications, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Python's capabilities. Letâ€™s get started!

Part 1: Introduction to Python
In this section, we'll cover the basics of Python programming. Analyze the provided code snippets to understand their functionality and outcomes. Experiment with these examples to deepen your understanding and make your own modifications.

Part 2: Strings
Explore the manipulation and operations of strings in Python. Analyze how different string operations affect the output and practice by writing and modifying your own string-handling codes.

Part 3: Numbers
This section focuses on numbers and basic arithmetic operations in Python. Review each line of code and its output to understand how mathematical operations are executed in Python.

Part 4: User Interactions
Learn how to interact with users using input and output functions. Customize these interactions according to your needs and extend the conversation length to suit different scenarios.

Part 5: Basic Calculator
Build a basic calculator using Python. Feel free to enhance it by adding your own features and functionalities to make it more versatile.

Part 6: Mad Libs Game
Create a fun Mad Libs game where users fill in the blanks. This will help you understand how to handle strings and user inputs in a creative way.

Part 7: Lists
Understand lists and their operations. Lists are fundamental in many programming tasks, so mastering their use is crucial for effective Python programming.

Part 8: List Functions
Explore various functions available for lists in Python. This section provides a professional overview of list manipulations. Experiment with different list functions to see their effects and try implementing your own list manipulations.

Part 9: Tuples
Tuples are immutable sequences used to store collections of heterogeneous data. This section will cover how to create tuples, access their elements, and work with tuples within lists.

Part 10: Functions
Functions are a fundamental concept in Python that allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks. This section demonstrates how to define and use functions in Python, including handling parameters and understanding the difference between function calls and variables.

Part 11: Return Statement
In Python, the return statement is used to send a result from a function back to the caller. It is an essential feature for making functions more versatile and reusable. This section explores how to use return to output values from functions and understand its impact on function execution.

Part 10: Functions
Functions are a fundamental concept in Python that allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks. This section demonstrates how to define and use functions in Python, including handling parameters and understanding the difference between function calls and variables.

Part 11: Return Statement
In Python, the return statement is used to send a result from a function back to the caller. It is an essential feature for making functions more versatile and reusable. This section explores how to use return to output values 
from functions and understand its impact on function execution.

Part 12: If Statement
In Python, the if statement is a fundamental control structure that allows you to execute code conditionally based on whether a certain condition is true. This section explores how to use if, elif, and else to control the flow of your program, making it more flexible and responsive to different situations.

Part 12: 
Comparisons in If Statement
In Python, you can use comparison operators within if statements to evaluate conditions and make decisions in your code. This section demonstrates how to use different comparison operators such as ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <= to compare values and control the execution flow of your program

Part 13: Advanced Calculator
This section demonstrates how to create an advanced calculator in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. The calculator takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user and performs the corresponding operation, displaying the result or an error message for invalid operators. This example highlights the use of if, elif, and else statements to control program flow based on user input.

Part 14: Dictionary
In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. This section covers how to create and access elements in a dictionary, as well as handle missing keys gracefully using the get method. The example demonstrates initializing a dictionary with day abbreviations as keys and their full names as values, accessing values using keys, and handling missing keys to avoid errors.

part 15
The while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True. Itâ€™s useful for scenarios where the number of iterations is not known beforehand. Here are some examples demonstrating different usages of the while loop.

Part 16: Building a Basic Game
In this section, we explore how to create a simple guessing game using Python. You'll learn to utilize while loops and conditional statements to build a game where the user must guess a predefined word within a limited number of attempts. This exercise demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling, providing a fun and interactive way to apply your Python knowledge.

Part 17: For Loop
In this section, we delve into the for loop, a powerful control structure in Python that allows you to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. This section covers various examples of for loops, demonstrating how to loop through strings, lists, and ranges, and how to incorporate conditional statements within the loop to perform different actions based on the iteration index or item.
