Basic Python Programming Guide
Welcome to a basic introduction to Python programming! This guide will walk you through fundamental aspects of Python, providing you with a strong foundation to build upon. By exploring the examples and trying your own modifications, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Python's capabilities. Letâ€™s get started!

Part 1: Introduction to Python
In this section, we'll cover the basics of Python programming. Analyze the provided code snippets to understand their functionality and outcomes. Experiment with these examples to deepen your understanding and make your own modifications.

Part 2: Strings
Explore the manipulation and operations of strings in Python. Analyze how different string operations affect the output and practice by writing and modifying your own string-handling codes.

Part 3: Numbers
This section focuses on numbers and basic arithmetic operations in Python. Review each line of code and its output to understand how mathematical operations are executed in Python.

Part 4: User Interactions
Learn how to interact with users using input and output functions. Customize these interactions according to your needs and extend the conversation length to suit different scenarios.

Part 5: Basic Calculator
Build a basic calculator using Python. Feel free to enhance it by adding your own features and functionalities to make it more versatile.

Part 6: Mad Libs Game
Create a fun Mad Libs game where users fill in the blanks. This will help you understand how to handle strings and user inputs in a creative way.

Part 7: Lists
Understand lists and their operations. Lists are fundamental in many programming tasks, so mastering their use is crucial for effective Python programming.

Part 8: List Functions
Explore various functions available for lists in Python. This section provides a professional overview of list manipulations. Experiment with different list functions to see their effects and try implementing your own list manipulations.

Part 9: Tuples
Tuples are immutable sequences used to store collections of heterogeneous data. This section will cover how to create tuples, access their elements, and work with tuples within lists.

Part 10: Functions
Functions are a fundamental concept in Python that allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks. This section demonstrates how to define and use functions in Python, including handling parameters and understanding the difference between function calls and variables.
